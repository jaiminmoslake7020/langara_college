                    on spendings made by each person and options chosen by person to give the division information of cost. It will also help a
                    person manage their cost and give you a report on how a person has made expenses in different categories and reports
                    give an idea to a person where they can save money.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Simple split web application wants to help people in keeping the records of expenses they make not only for them but also
                    for other people. So they can know how much they owe to X person and how much Y person owes to them. This way they

                <p><b>Let see how it can help our ideal user Jim Harper.</b></p>
                <p>Jim Harper is a 26-year-old male who is living in Vancouver. He right now livers at 33rd avenue Fraser street with 3 other
                    people in sharing. They all do grocery shopping together or whenever a person from the group is free goes for grocery
                    shopping and shops for different things what they need so at different times different person makes expenses and it is hard
                    to remember all expenses. So here Jim can use our app and solve all these problems of keeping records of all these
                    expenses. Because Jim leaves in sharing and shares his expenses with other people, this situation makes him the ideal
                    customer of our web app.</p>
