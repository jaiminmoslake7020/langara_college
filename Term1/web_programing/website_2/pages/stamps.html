                            In March, 1859, Mr. Griffin wrote to the printers in New York and stated that the
                            Postmaster General wished to procure postage stamps expressed in cents instead of
                            pence. On the 16th March, the Department placed an order for 1-cent, 5-cent,
                            10-cent, 12 ½-cent, and 17-cent denominations of similar designs to those used in 
                            the past issues.Portrait of Queen Victoria from a contemporary postage stamp design

                            In 1954, the first QEII definitive design was introduced, including a
                            Wilding profile head. The design was similar to the previous Hong Kong
                            definitives for King George VI, which is nice if you like continuation, 
                            but not half as spectacular as some of its successors. So we move on swiftly
                            to the next set, introduced in 1962, based on the famous Annigoni portrait. 
                            A massive leap forward as far as originality and beauty is concerned.

                            The fantail featured in a special pictorial issue of stamps in the 1930s.
                            The fantail or 'piwakawaka' in Maori, is a very sociable New Zealand native.
                            The bird's name derives from its beautiful tail of twelve feathers, which
                            broadly expands as the bird flits about. In the background of the design is
                            one of the best-known flowers of the New Zealand bush, the beautiful clematis, 
                            which is particularly appropriate, as both the bird and the flower are usually
                            found near the edge of the forest.
