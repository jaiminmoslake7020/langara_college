                            Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures, written  about the year 190 A. D. The
                            Chinese bead abacus has a rectangular wooden frame with thin rods across it. On each
                            rod are placed seven glass or wooden beads: five below the strip of wood, that divides
                            the frame into two unequal parts, and two above it.
