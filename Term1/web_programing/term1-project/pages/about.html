                <p><b>Let see how it can help our ideal user Jim Harper.</b></p>
                <p>Jim Harper is a 26-year-old male who is living in Vancouver. He right now livers at 33rd avenue Fraser street with 3 other
                    people in sharing. They all do grocery shopping together or whenever a person from the group is free goes for grocery
                    shopping and shops for different things what they need so at different times different person makes expenses and it is hard
                    to remember all expenses. So here Jim can use our app and solve all these problems of keeping records of all these
                    expenses. Because Jim leaves in sharing and shares his expenses with other people, this situation makes him the ideal
                    customer of our web app.</p>
